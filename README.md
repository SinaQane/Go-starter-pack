# Go-starter-pack

A starter pack for learning the basics of programming with Go Language 

It's mostly for my own usage so that I won't forget how Go Lang works. I learned most of what I've added here from YouTube channels or Go documents. So it's nothing new, Just a couple of files with some examples of basic topics in Go. I'll add new topics to this repository when I learn them (and of course, heve the time to do it).
