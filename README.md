# go-starter-kit

A starter kit for learning the basics of programming with Go Language 

It's mostly for my own usage so that I won't forget how Go Lang works. I learned the most of it from YouTube channels or Go documents. I'll add new topics (Concurrency, Network, etc.) to this repository when I learn them (and heve the time to do it).
